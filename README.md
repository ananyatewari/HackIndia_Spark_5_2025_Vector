# 🚀 Speakly-BotAI — Your Autonomous AI Meeting Companion

## 🎯 The Problem

Remote meetings are packed with value—but:

- 🔍 Action items often go unnoticed  
- ✍️ Notes and summaries are inconsistent  
- ⏳ Nobody wants to replay an hour-long call  

Most tools stop at transcription.  
**Speakly** goes further—it makes your meetings *work for you.*
